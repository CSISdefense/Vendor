## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r MajCom}

MajCom<-NULL
path<-"..\\Data_Raw\\SAM\\DoD_Office_Info\\"
files<-list.files(path) 

for(f in unique(files)){
  m<-read_csv(file=file.path(path,f),skip=5)
  MajCom<-rbind(MajCom,m)
}

MajCom<-standardize_variable_names(MajCom)
key<-colnames(MajCom)

write.csv(MajComID,file=file.path("..","data","semi_clean","MajComID.csv"))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
