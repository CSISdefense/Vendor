## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Biotechnology}
bioecon %>% group_by(NASbioEconomy,biobased) %>%
  summarise(value=sum(X13,na.rm=TRUE)) %>% group_by(NASbioEconomy) %>%
    mutate(p=value/sum(value,na.rm=TRUE))

bioecon %>% group_by(NASbioEconomy,biobased) %>%
  summarise(value=sum(X13,na.rm=TRUE)) %>% group_by(biobased) %>%
    mutate(p=value/sum(value,na.rm=TRUE))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
