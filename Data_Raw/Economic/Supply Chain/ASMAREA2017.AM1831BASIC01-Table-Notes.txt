<p><b>Methodology:</b><br>
To maintain confidentiality, the U.S. Census Bureau suppresses data to protect the identity of any business or individual. The census results in this file contain sampling and/or nonsampling error. Data users who create their own estimates using data from this file should cite the U.S. Census Bureau as the source of the original data only.<p/>
<p>To comply with disclosure avoidance guidelines, data rows with fewer than three contributing establishments are not presented. Additionally, establishment counts are suppressed when other select statistics in the same row are suppressed. For detailed information about the methods used to collect and produce statistics, including sampling, eligibility, questions, data collection and processing, data quality, review, weighting, estimation, coding operations, confidentiality protection, sampling error, nonsampling error, and more, see <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/asm/technical-documentation/methodology.html">Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM): Technical Documentation: Annual Survey of Manufactures Methodology.</a></p>

<p><b>Symbols:</b><br>
D - Withheld to avoid disclosing data of individual companies; data are included in higher level totals<br>
N - Not available or not comparable<br>
S - Estimate does not meet publication standards because of high sampling variability, poor response quality, or other concerns about the estimate quality. Unpublished estimates derived from this table by subtraction are subject to these same limitations and should not be attributed to the U.S. Census Bureau. For a description of publication standards and the total quantity response rate, see link to program methodology page.<br>
X - Not applicable<br>
A - Relative standard error of 100% or more<br>
r - Revised (represented as a superscript)<br>
s - Relative standard error is 40 percent or more and less than 100 percent (data variable displayed as a superscript)<br>
