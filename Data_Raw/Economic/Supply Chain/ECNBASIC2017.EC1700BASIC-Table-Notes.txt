  NOTES
=============================================================================================================

<p>Sector 51 Revision: June 2, 2020</p>
<p>Data shown in "All Sectors: Summary Statistics for the U.S., States, and Selected Geographies: 2017" and "Information: Summary Statistics for the U.S., States, and Selected Geographies: 2017" have been revised after conducting additional analytical review that revealed classification uncertainties within the Information sector (NAICS 51). As a result, some data are suppressed to ensure that confidentiality is adequately protected. The originally released data were publicly available from January 9, 2020 - June 2, 2020. The revised data were released June 2, 2020.</p>

<p><b>Methodology:</b><br>
To maintain confidentiality, the U.S. Census Bureau suppresses data to protect the identity of any business or individual. The census results in this file contain sampling and/or nonsampling error. Data users who create their own estimates using data from this file should cite the U.S. Census Bureau as the source of the original data only.</p>

<p>To comply with disclosure avoidance guidelines, data rows with fewer than three contributing establishments are not presented.  Additionally, establishment counts are suppressed when other select statistics in the same row are suppressed.  For detailed information about the methods used to collect and produce statistics, including sampling, eligibility, questions, data collection and processing, data quality, review, weighting, estimation, coding operations, confidentiality protection, sampling error, nonsampling error, and more, see <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/economic-census/technical-documentation/methodology.html"> Economic Census: Technical Documentation: Methodology.</a></p>

<p><b>Symbols:</b><br>
D - Withheld to avoid disclosing data for individual companies; data are included in higher level totals<br>
N - Not available or not comparable<br>
S - Estimate does not meet publication standards because of high sampling variability, poor response quality, or other concerns about the estimate quality. Unpublished estimates derived from this table by subtraction are subject to these same limitations and should not be attributed to the U.S. Census Bureau. For a description of publication standards and the total quantity response rate, see link to program methodology page.<br>
X - Not applicable<br>
A - Relative standard error of 100% or more<br>
r - Revised<br>
s - Relative standard error exceeds 40%<br>

<p><b>Release Schedule:</b><br>
The data in this file come from the 2017 Economic Census data files released on a flow basis starting in September 2019. <b><i>As such, preliminary U.S. totals released in September 2019 will be superseded with final totals, by sector, once data for all states have been released.</i></b> Users should be aware that during the release of this consolidated file, data at more detailed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and geographic levels may not add to higher-level totals. However, at the completion of the economic census (once all the component files have been released), the detailed data in this file will add to the totals.
